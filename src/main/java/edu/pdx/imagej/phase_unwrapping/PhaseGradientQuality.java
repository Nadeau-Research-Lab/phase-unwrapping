/** GradientQuality is a {@link Quality} that uses the "phase gradient" of an
 * image.  The Phase Gradient is like the gradient, but it considers 0 and 2Ï€ to
 * be next to each other.  It assigns a higher value to spots with a lower
 * gradient.
 * <p>
 * The idea behind this quality is that the background has a lower phase
 * gradient than any samples, so that the background gets unwrapped first.
 * Then, if there are any unwrapping errors in the sample, they will stay local.
